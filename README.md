- [ ] Page to view all projects
  - [ ] With filtering: ongoing, technical, jewish, etc.
- [ ] Quick links to blogs/merch
- [ ] Page for all *content*â€”maybe this should instead be a substack?
- [ ] Github integration
  - [ ] Automatically pull every new github repo
  - [ ] Automatically label a repo on hiatus if not updated in two months
- [ ] Blog integration
  - [ ] Automatically pull most recent content from substack
